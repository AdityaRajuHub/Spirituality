SHAMANIC HEALING 

Shamanic healing is a spiritual and medical practice based upon the belief that all healing includes a spiritual dimension. Shamanic medicine is a tradition dating back 25000 years. To better understand how a shamanic healing works it is important to understand some of the fundamental concepts of what shamanism is. It is a specific set of methodologies for accessing the spirit or energy field of anything or anyone. The essential perspective of shamanism is:

Everything is alive. Everything has spirit and awareness.

Energy and matter are the same. Everything is vibration. Everything that exists is an energy system within a greater energy system.
Everything that exists is connected to everything else in a web of energy or life.

Unseen/inner/spiritual reality affects visible reality.

Working within this system of perceptions, the healer strives to create balance and harmony of the spirit. This is a physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual balance and can be focused on the individual or the community. This also can be applied to anything that exists.

By using shamanic practices a wide spectrum of healing is possible. Shamanic healing takes place in many forms, depending on what spirit recommends. This can include plant, herb and mineral spirit medicine, the use of song and other instruments to move and transform energy, visualization, soul retrieval, extraction, hands on massage or physical body manipulation. The shamanic practitioner understands the necessity to use both nature and spirit in healing and that true healing is whole and complete: body, mind and spirit.
