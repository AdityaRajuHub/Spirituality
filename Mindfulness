Mindfulness - Mind Body Connection

Being mindful and aware of our actions and actually visualizing the outcome we are hoping for helps not only with manifestation, 
but helps immensely with the mind-body connection. So much untapped awareness and intuitive knowledge about our surroundings lives in our body. 
Our emotions live in the body and feed us information from many levels that our conscious mind is not aware of and will not necessarily pick up on unless we train that awareness.

Being mindful can help to start strengthening our mind body connection. Try intentionally visualizing in conjunction with whatever you are doing, however mundane; 
visualize strong and healthy teeth while brushing your teeth, visualizing being cleaned on all levels while in the shower, 
visualizing strong healthy energy reinforcing every cell in your body while eating food. 
Try this practice in the simplest routine things you are doing...instead of say...scrolling through your phone.

Try practicing mindfulness in this way. This practice will start help to strengthen the body-mind connection. 
When the mind-body connection strengthens it not only opens you up and strengthens your manifestation skills, 
it also strengthens intuition, strengthens multi-dimensional awareness, strengthens energetic flow, strengthens your ability to work with your own energy, 
and all of the energy around you.

You create your own reality. If you are not paying attention to what you are creating, then what is creating your reality?
